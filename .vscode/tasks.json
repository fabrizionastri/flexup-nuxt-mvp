// tasks.json

/* Steps to Implement the Solution
Install Necessary Extensions: Install "Linux/Unix/WSL paths" and a macro extension like "multi-command".
Configure a Task in tasks.json: Create a task that uses ${command:wsl-path.getRelativePath} to get the Unix-like path.
Create a Macro: Set up a macro that runs the above task and copies the output to the clipboard.
Bind the Macro to a Keyboard Shortcut: In keybindings.json, create a new binding that triggers the macro when you press your desired shortcut keys.
Example tasks.json & Macro Setup
This is a hypothetical setup, as the actual implementation might vary based on the capabilities and syntax of the extensions used:

json
Copy code
// tasks.json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Copy Unix Path",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "echo ${command:wsl-path.getRelativePath} | clip" // This is a simplified example
        }
    ]
}
json
Copy code
// keybindings.json
{
    "key": "ctrl+alt+c", // Choose your preferred shortcut
    "command": "extension.multiCommand.execute",
    "args": {
        "sequence": ["workbench.action.tasks.runTask", "Copy Unix Path"]
    }
}
Final Notes
This setup is theoretical and may require adjustments to fit the exact behavior of the extensions and VS Code's capabilities.
It's important to test and refine the setup to ensure it meets your specific needs.
