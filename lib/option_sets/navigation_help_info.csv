[li][b]payment structure[/b]: the split of the remuneration into one or more [b]tranches[/b], each with a specific [b]payment terms[/b].[/li][/ul]

In the [u]FlexUp app[/u], a contract also offers a convenient way manage one or more [b]orders[/b], where each order correspond to the delivery of a specific set of products (i.e. [b]order items[/b]). A contract may include one or more [b]orders[/b], which can be [b]confirmed[/b] upon contract [b]signature[/b], or later on.

"mdi:people-switch","A [b]third party[/b] is any account other than the current account. It can represent a client or a supplier. 

A third-party can be:

- a [b]local[/b] account: this is a ""virtual"" account that has been created by, and is only visible by, the the current account. It has not yet been shared/claimed by the ""real"" third-party that it represents in the system.

You can create a local account to keep track of transactions with a third-party that is not registered in the system.

Whenever you add an account (active or local) to your [b]third-party directory[/b], the system associates it with some default values for:
- role (client or supplier),
- currency, country,
- order/contract nature/type,
- applicable charter (if any).

This streamlines the process of creating new contracts/orders with this third-party in the future.

In the FlexUp model, the term [b]third party[/b] means any account other than this [b]current account [/b](the one you are currently active in).
